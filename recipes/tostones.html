        <h2>Description</h2>
        <strong>Tostones</strong> are crispy fried plantains that are smashed and fried twice to create a savory appetizer, snack or side dish! Popular throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, we are serving these fried plantains Puerto Rican style with a traditional garlicky mayo-ketchup dip!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Green Plantains</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Lime Juice</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make The Seasoned Water: In a medium sized bowl, whisk together water, garlic, kosher salt and lime juice. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat Up the Oil: Heat the vegetable oil over medium heat, in a large deep heavy bottomed pan. You want the oil to be about a third of the way up the side of the pan. </li>
            <li>Cook the Plantains: Fry the peeled and sliced plantains in batches. Add about a third of the plantain slices to the pan and let them cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden but still slightly pale.</li>
            <li>Let the Plantains Cool: Remove plantains from the oil and place them on a cookie cooling rack or a plate with a paper towel. Repeat the frying process in batches with the remaining plantain pieces.</li>
            <li>Smash the Plantains: Smash each of the plantains with a tostonera, the bottom of a glass, or two plates stacked on top of each other. Do not too press too hard or they may start to break apart, but you do want to flatten them!</li>
            <li>Dip The Plantains: Dip the smashed plantain into your water/garlic/lime/salt mixture. Let it sit in the water for a few seconds, drain off the water mixture and add the smashed plantain back into the oil.</li>
            <li>Re-Fry: Fry them for about 2 minutes more on each side, or until they turn a dark golden color and they have turned crispy on the edges.</li>
            <li>Season and Serve: Transfer back to a paper towel lined plate to drain any excess oil. Immediately sprinkle the tostones with salt. Serve as desired, I recommend with some Mayo-Ketchup Sauce to dip them into!</li>
